Got interested in soft-bodies lately and decided to create this!

It's a tool to create rectangular soft bodies of any size and specification, in jelly form.

The bodies are based off a spring-mass model, and the spring constant, damping factor, spring length, and all that good stuff can be updated in edit mode or play mode (that took a lotta work with editor scripts).

Looking to create a 3D version after this, gonna look into making a translucent texture to make it all the more jelly-like.
